| Hard Drive       | A high-capacity, self-contained storage device containing a read-write mechanism plus one or more hard disks, inside a sealed unit. Also called hard disk drive.| Backblaze implements serval different models of hard drives with varying capacities|
| Reliability      | A boolean classification of low reliability or high reliability based on drive failure rate and lifespan| |
| Failure          | Contains a “0” if the drive is OK. Contains a “1” if this is the last day the drive was operational before failing.| |
| Early Failure    | A failure which occurs in a hard drive where age in years is less than 2.6 years old.| Calculated using feature SMART 9 - power on hours / 365 / 24 |
| SMART Attributes | SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) is a monitoring system included in hard drives used to detect and report various indicators of drive reliability with the intent of anticipating imminent hardware failures. | There are several SMART attributes in the data. Detailed information on each attribute can be found in our smart_attributes_index.md |
| Serial Number    | The manufacturer-assigned serial number of the drive.| |
| Model            | The manufacturer-assigned model number of the drive.| |
| Manufacturer     | The manufacturer/company that built the hard drive. The manufacturer information is derived from the model number through additional research.| |
| Capacity         | The drive capacity (amount of storage) measured in bytes.| Converted bytes to terabytes using the following calculation: capacity_bytes / 1,000,000,000,000|
