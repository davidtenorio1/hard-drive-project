| Hard Drive       | A high-capacity, self-contained storage device containing a read-write mechanism plus one or more hard disks, inside a sealed unit. Also called hard disk drive.                                                                        | Backblaze implements serval different models of hard drives with varying capacities                                                |
| Reliability      | A boolean classification of low reliability or high reliability based on drive failure rate and lifespan                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                    |
| Failure          | Contains a “0” if the drive is OK. Contains a “1” if this is the last day the drive was operational before failing.                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                    |
| Early Failure    | A failure which occurs in a hard drive where power on hours are less than 1,000                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                    |
| SMART Attributes | SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) is a monitoring system included in hard drives used to detect and report various indicators of drive reliability with the intent of anticipating imminent hardware failures. | There are several SMART attributes in the data. Detailed information on each attribute can be found in our smart attribute index.d |
| Serial Number    | The manufacturer-assigned serial number of the drive.| daslkfj|
| Model            | The manufacturer-assigned model number of the drive.                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                    |
| Manufacturer     | The manufacturer/company that built the hard drive.
