## Hard Drive Project
#### Sagacious Analytics

Goal: Determine the reliability of hard drives by model. 

Raw data from 2016 to 2019 was acquired from [BackBlaze.com](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html#downloading-the-raw-hard-drive-test-data). The data was aggregated by serial number. The max values of the top five identified SMART stats for hard drive failures were retrieved for each unique serial number.
