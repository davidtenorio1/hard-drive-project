## Hard Drive Project
#### Sagacious Analytics


### Goal: 
The goal of this project is to determine the reliability of hard drive models, and to create a model that predicts whether or not a hard drive will fail.  Our target audience includes users of specific hard drive models in our dataset, as well as consumers in the market for a new hard drive. Our project deliverables include a jupyter notebook detailing our process, a handout ranking the hard drive models by reliability, and a slide show presentation summarizing our findings.  

### Background:
#### The data:
Raw data from 2016 to 2019 is acquired from [BackBlaze.com](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html#downloading-the-raw-hard-drive-test-data). The data is aggregated by serial number. The max values of the top five identified SMART stats for hard drive failures are retrieved for each unique serial number.
