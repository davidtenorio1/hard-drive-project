## Hard Drive Project
#### Sagacious Analytics

Goal: Determine the reliability of hard drives by model. 

The data was acquired from [BackBlaze.com]('https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html#downloading-the-raw-hard-drive-test-data')

The data was aggregated by serial number. The max values of the top five identified SMART attributes for hard drive failures were retrieved. 

The aggregated data can be accessed here as a csv:
