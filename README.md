## Hard Drive Project
#### Just Keep Spinning


### Goal: 
The goal of this project is to determine the reliability of hard drive models and create a model that predicts whether or not a hard drive will fail early.  Our target audience includes users of the specific hard drive models in our dataset as well as consumers in the market for a new hard drive. Our project deliverables include a jupyter notebook detailing our process, a handout ranking hard drive models by highest and lowest reliability, and a slide show presentation summarizing our findings.  

### Background:
#### The data:
Raw data from 2016 to 2019 is acquired from [BackBlaze.com](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html#downloading-the-raw-hard-drive-test-data). The data is aggregated by serial number. The max values of the top five identified SMART stats for hard drive failures are retrieved for each unique serial number.

#### Hypotheses:
- The 5 SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) stats identified by Backblaze will indicate device hard drive failure
- Hard drive fail rates will vary by model
- Hard drives fail rates will vary by manufacturer

#### Data dictionary:
